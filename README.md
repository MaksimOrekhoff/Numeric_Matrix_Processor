# Numeric_Matrix_Processor

It is a simple numeric matrix processor. It can be used to perform some algebraic transformations on matrices. 
This code allows you to perform the following operations: addition and multiplication of matrices by each other, 
multiplication of a matrix by a constant, transposition of a matrix (relative to the vertical, horizontal, main and secondary diagonals), 
determine the determinant of a matrix, find the inverse matrix by the method of algebraic complements
